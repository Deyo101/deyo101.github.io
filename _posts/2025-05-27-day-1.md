what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about the other undergrads in the program, and got closer to my team members. We spent some time talking to each other and playing ice breaker games, and that was a nice team building experience. I also learned more about Git and GitHub. It was an educative experience.

  No blocker. 
  
reflection: |
  It was really nice to get to know everyone and to learn something new.
