what_i_learned: |
  I refreshed my Python knowledge in this class. We went over data types, the print function, and how to identify different value types. I also got to speak with my research professor and graduate assistant, they were nice. I enjoyed the games and the introductions.

blockers: |
  No blocker.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed the Kahoot games our Python 101 teacher, Clyde, gave us. They were fun and competitive.Learning in that way is a lot more refreshing. I also liked the team building game at the end.
