what_i_learned: |
  There was a workshop first that took us through how to train computer models on various objects. I trained my model on a phone, a jacket, and a bag. I also learned how to use google Colab. After the Computer Vision Workshop, I played an escape room game with my team members. It was a nice brain stimulator, a little difficult though, since none of us had ever been to an escape room. In the end, we had another Python 101 class, and we were taught how to get user inputs, change data types, and create variables. 
  
blockers: |
  The only blocker I had was in the escape room game. 
  
reflection: |
  I like spending time with my team members, getting to know them has been fun so far, and the python 101 classes have been interesting too. I like our teacher.
