what_i_learned: |
  We were taught how to use conditional statements in python, and operational statements too. At the end, I amde a project designed to calculate a student;s grade depending on their input. After that, Clyde gave us a short course on Generative AI and how we got to that. We played some Kahoot! games, and it was really fun. There was a short team building exercise after, where me abd my team members went through a slide of 19 pictures and tried to guess which were AI created and which were not.

blockers: |
  No blocker.

reflection: |
  Making my project for Python 101 was really fun and educative, and Clyde's course on Gen AI was nice too. I enjoyed the AI guessing game we played at the end also.
