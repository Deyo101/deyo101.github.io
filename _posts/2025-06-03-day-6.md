what_i_learned: |
  I came to Morgan State University's campus today for the first on-site class. We all met up at the Business school and the faculty mentors and graduate mentors introduced themselves. After the introductions and a brief meeting with Dr. Waters, my team and I (including the mentors), played a fun team building game. When we all split up into our teams, I was given some videos to watch that taught me more about python. From the videos, I learnt more about operational functions in python, and more about data types.

blockers: |
  I had a bit of a problem with setting up Jupyter notebook on my Anaconda, because none of the files I made were opening when clicked. It took about an hour and a half to get it fixed with the help of my graduate mentor.

reflection: |
  It was nice getting to meet and see everyone in real life. I enjoyed the games we played together, and I find it exciting that we're starting these projects now, and I'm getting some experience.
