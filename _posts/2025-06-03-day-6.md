what_i_learned: |
  My graduate mentor, Amara, gave us some videos on Python to watch yesterday, 22 in total. So when I came in, I carried on from where I stopped. I learned how to make dictionaries, tuples, sets, numpy arrays, pandas series, data frames, and how to manipulate strings. I also learned the various calculations that could be done with each data structure, such as calculating its mean, or its log, splitting it, flipping it, etc.

blockers: |
  No blocker.

reflection: |
  It was a bit boring staring at my laptop all day, but I understand that I have to watch everything to better prepare myself for the research project.
