what_i_learned: |
  I continued from where I left off yesterday. I watched more videos teaching me about Python, and now the videos are starting to get a bit more complicated. I spent a lot of time staring at the screen absentmindedly, but after a while I got the concepts. Ilearned how to make functions, lambdas, how to use for loops to make a list, how to import a data set, change the index, make a new column and add it to the set, and so much more. There were some stuff concerning text data i wasn't able to follow along with, but I'll get there eventually. 

blockers: |
  I had a bit of a problem with some of the python concepts involving text data sets, but I plan on going home to review it once more by myself.

reflection: |
  It's getting a bit more difficult and it's just day 7. Hopefully I start understanding a bit faster before I end up falling behind. I think I need to practice a lot more to get better, otherwise nothing much will change. My graduate and faculty mentor have been quite nice, but I wish there were regular tests or little activities they made us do to implement the things I'm learning, because that's usually what helps me learn faster. Overall though, it's not been too bad.
