what_i_learned: |
  I spent the first half of today on a campus tour. We walked around the school and Dr. Waters and Michael gave a brief description of each building we went into. It was nice exploring each new location and seeing just how big the campus really is. After, we all went back to our teams, and I carried on watching the Python videos from where I stopped yesterday. This time, I learned how to join different data sets and plot higher dimensional frequency tables with data sets.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed the breif break from learning. It was nice walking around and talking with the other students. I really liked the nursing building, the interior was cool. The Python concepts I elarned today weren't too hard to understand, so that was good too.
