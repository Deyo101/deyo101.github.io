what_i_learned: |
  Ms. Amara gave us a new set of videos to watch today. They were on MATLAB. They Were much shorter than the python videos so I made more progress today. I learned how to write comments, break codes into sections, create functions, create horizontal and vertical matrices, get user inputs, display outputs, use various in-built functions (max, abs, sqrt, eye, zeros, det, floor, fix, roots, table, etc).I also learned how to perform mathematical operations with matrices, and how to multiply uneven matrices. 

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was nice having a relaxing day to go over everything I've done. I was able to refresh my memory on what I'd studied, and writing it down cements it in my brain more. Having the zoom meeting with my team members was okay. We each made our aprt and no disagreements were had. We work well together in my opinion.
