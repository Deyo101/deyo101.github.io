what_i_learned: |
  Ms. Amara gave us a new set of videos to watch today. They were on MATLAB. They Were much shorter than the python videos so I made more progress today. I learned how to write comments, break codes into sections, create functions, create horizontal and vertical matrices, get user inputs, display outputs, use various in-built functions (max, abs, sqrt, eye, zeros, det, floor, fix, roots, table, etc).I also learned how to perform mathematical operations with matrices, and how to multiply uneven matrices.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed learning more about MATLAB today. It was a nice change of pace. Plus the fact that the videos were shorter made it easier for me to focus. MATLAB is similar to Python so it's not like I'm doing something completely new, so it's kind of easy. I don't think I'll feel it's easy for long though, there are like 20 videos to go.
