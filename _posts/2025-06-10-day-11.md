what_i_learned: |
  I wasn't able to accomplish much today because MATLAB Online wasn't working so my graduate mentor and I were trying to figure something out.  After a while we decided that I should just sign up for the 30 day free trial and use that to get the download link. It took a while to download it, but after a while, it was successful. I had to leave shortly after though, because of some persoanl issues.
blockers: |
  I had an issue with accessing MATLAB online but Ms. Amara helped me resolve that.

reflection: |
  It's a bit upsetting that I lost about two hours of work time because MATLab online was down for me, because I like to have these little races with one of my team members to see who gets further faster, so that significantly delayed me. I had to leave shortly after the issue was solved though, and it was fun working from home. I didn't accomplish much though, so it was fun but unproductive.
