what_i_learned: |
  I came in late so I wasn't able to accomplish a lot. I was able to watch a few videos on some more MATLAB concepts though. I learned how to write for loops and if conditionals. I also learned about relational symbols, such as AND, OR, ~=, ==, etc.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I still find MATLAB to be a nice programming language to learn. It hasn't gotten overly complicated yet, so that makes watching the videos enjoyable for me.
