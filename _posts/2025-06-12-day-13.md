what_i_learned: |
  We had the enrichment block today at the Business school, and that was really fun. We started with taboo, and the other team won, then we played Jenga, and my team won. We all won an hour off school. After that, we went back to our teams and I started on the R video my graduate mentor sent. I learned about the data types in R, how to make vectors, matrices, maps, how to write in markdown, how to create functions, and how to write conditionals. It's a bit different from Python so it's a little trickier.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  The games we played in the morning were fun. I like the prize we were given. Learning R took me a bit longer since it's kind of different from Python. It's nice learning new skills though, so although I dislike it, I'm sure it can help me down the road.
