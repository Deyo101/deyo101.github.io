what_i_learned: |
  I wasn't able to come in today because of a previous commitment, but I filled out a dismissal form. I was able to go over everything I've done throughout the week though, and made a short Google Slides slide summarizing that. I attended a zoom meeting with my team members and graduate mentor and presented the slides. I spoke about my accomplishments, and the problems I experienced.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was nice having a relaxing day to go over everything I've done. I was able to refresh my memory on what I'd studied, and writing it down cements it in my brain more. Having the zoom meeting with my team members was okay. We each made our aprt and no disagreements were had. We work well together in my opinion.
