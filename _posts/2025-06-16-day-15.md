what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to split, train, and test various data tests and figure out how accurate the predictions I come up with are. Using various sources, such as ELM, KNN, and SVC, I learned the various codes needed to create a data set and split it up into a training set and testing set. I learned more about the sklearn library, and a bunch of functions that came with it. I also learned how to derive hyper planes from a data set and create different types of svc plots (linear, poly, etc).

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was nice learning something new. The tasks I did were done with Python so I liked being able to implement the knowledge I'd gained earlier on. Learning how to train and test data was intriguing, especially since I got to see how accurate the answeres were in the end. We'll be learning some more machine learning concepts tomorrow so there's a lot more to it than I've seen so far.
