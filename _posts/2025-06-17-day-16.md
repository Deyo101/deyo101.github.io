what_i_learned: |
  I continued wtaching the video on R. I learned how to import and read files, call on specific rows or columns, split, rename, and slice columns, among a lot of other things. I also learned about this interesting concept in R called piping. After our lunch break, our graduate mentor gave us a small data set to play around with a bit. She gave us some instructions and assigned us languages to use onnthe data sets. I used Python and MATLAB.  

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed being given a task to do with the languages I've been learning. It was a nice change of pace from just learning to applying. So far R hasn't been so difficult, so it hasn't been so bad either. We'll be starting to work with more data sets next week so that's also a bit exciting.
