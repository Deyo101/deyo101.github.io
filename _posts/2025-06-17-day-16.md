what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot about machine learning. In the video I watched, we took a break from the coding aspect to learn more about what machine learning itself is. I learned about the different types (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning), and the subsets of some of the types, such as classification and regression. I also learned about decision trees, the different parts that make up a tree (root, nodes, leaf), and how the computer calculates what label to use as the node using the lowest gini impurity. Learning about decision trees made it easier for me to understand why we wrote what we wrote in the ELM, SVC, and KNN machine learning codes.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed being given a task to do with the languages I've been learning. It was a nice change of pace from just learning to applying. So far R hasn't been so difficult, so it hasn't been so bad either. We'll be starting to work with more data sets next week so that's also a bit exciting.
