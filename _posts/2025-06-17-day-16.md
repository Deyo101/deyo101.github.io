what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot about machine learning. In the video I watched, we took a break from the coding aspect to learn more about what machine learning itself is. I learned about the different types (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning), and the subsets of some of the types, such as classification and regression.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed being given a task to do with the languages I've been learning. It was a nice change of pace from just learning to applying. So far R hasn't been so difficult, so it hasn't been so bad either. We'll be starting to work with more data sets next week so that's also a bit exciting.
