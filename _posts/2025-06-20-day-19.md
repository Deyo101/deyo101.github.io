what_i_learned: |
  I started on a video about Random Forest. I learned why random forest was sometimes preferred over decision trees, and the various characteristics of both. I had to leave for a while because of the driving simulator experiment, and that took about 2 hours of my time.  

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I like learning about the theoretical aspect of coding. Why my code does what it does. It's nice to really understand the concepts behind the code. The youtube video I'm watching for random forests focuses more on explaining the code rather than coding.
