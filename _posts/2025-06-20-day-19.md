what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot about machine learning. In the video I watched, we took a break from the coding aspect to learn more about what machine learning itself is. I learned about the different types (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning), and the subsets of some of the types, such as classification and regression. I also learned about decision trees, the different parts that make up a tree (root, nodes, leaf), and how the computer calculates what label to use as the node using the lowest gini impurity. Learning about decision trees made it easier for me to understand why we wrote what we wrote in the ELM, SVC, and KNN machine learning codes.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I liked learning the why of the data training and testing code. Why we wrote specific stuff and what went on behind the scenes. The video I watched today was very insightful and fun to watch. It would have been nicer if that was the first video given to us, because learning everything else before learning about decision trees was a bit more difficult.
