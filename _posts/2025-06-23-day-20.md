what_i_learned: |
  I looked through 17 different research papers today and selected 4 that looked the most interesting to me. After arranging them in order of most interesting to least, I sent them to my graduate mentor. After that, I watched the video on Random Forests that had been sent to us.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed today's enrichment block. The Lost at Sea game was fun and the game we played to identify our teachers was cool too. Meeting Ron was a pleasant experience. I like the way the guy in the Decision Trees video explains the code, it's easier for me to follow along.
