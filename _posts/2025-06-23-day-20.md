what_i_learned: |
  I looked through 17 different research papers today and selected 4 that looked the most interesting to me. After arranging them in order of most interesting to least, I sent them to my graduate mentor. After that, I CONTINUED WATCHING the video on Random Forests that had been sent to us. I learned about bagging, randomizing columns, out of bag data, how to code a random forest, and how to create a confusion matrix using the OOB predictions.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Scanning through all 17 papers was a bit time consuming, but I'm glad that I was able to find 4 that piqued my interest. Majority of the four are business-related, so it'll be useful for my major if i work on them. I also enjoyed learning about random forest. It was pretty similar to decision trees, just a little bit different.
