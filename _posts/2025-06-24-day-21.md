what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a meeting with all the other students and the program supervisors. Some questions were addressed then we played a short game with our team members. After that we were introduced to the high school teachers that will be working with us, my team's teacher is Ron. He's nice. After lunch I continued with the video on decision trees I was watching yesterday and I learned more about how to plot a decision tree and create one with Python.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed today's enrichment block. The Lost at Sea game was fun and the game we played to identify our teachers was cool too. Meeting Ron was a pleasant experience. I like the way the guy in the Decision Trees video explains the code, it's easier for me to follow along.
