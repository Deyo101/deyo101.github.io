what_i_learned: |
  I was given a research paper to dive deeper into and replicate today. The paper was on credit card fraud, and detailed how the reseacrhers created a machine learning ensemble tool that combined decision trees, random forest, knn, mlp, and ens machine learning models. In the paper, they started by using each machine learning model individually to get the metric scores for the data, so after reading the paper, I did so too. I implemented the decision tree model on the credit card dataset.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  It was nice getting to practice solving real world problems with what I've been learning so far. At first I was a bit confused, but after some time it was easy to follow along. Although the metric scores I ended up with were a little different since the researchers balanced out their data, but I made the decision not to do the same since it could result in me having a completely different data set. I'll try getting the metric scores of the balanced data set tomorrow probably.
