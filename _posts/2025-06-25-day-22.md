what_i_learned: |
  I went over the research paper I read yesterday again today. My graduate mentor wanted Nigam and I to do a deeper dive into the paper. My high school teacher, Ron, was really helpful in figuring out what to take note of specifically. He gave us a little template he likes using, and I used that to highlight the required information in the paper. At the end of the day I had a zoom meeting with Miss Amara, Nigam and Ron, where Nigam and I gave a short presentation on the paper. Ron is quite helpful, and he brought me some Rick and Morty comics cause I mentioned I liked the show so that was thoughtful.

blockers: |
  The concepts used in the paper were a bit hard to understand but watching Nigam do it helped me grasp the concepts.

reflection: |
  I spent the better half of today reading the research paper and trying to understand the terms and concepts used. Nigam understood it a bit better than me so he did most of the implementation and explained it to me. I prefer doing the literature review and implementations to watching the training videos. Tomorrow, we get our own data sets and start working on them, so that's something to look forward to.
