what_i_learned: |
  Today we were meant to get our data sets, but something came up and we were given another research paper to read. My paper was comparing the various KNN algorithms and figuring out which is best in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The goal was to find the version of KNN that worked best for predicting diseases. In the end, HKNN had the best accuracy score, EKNN had the best precision score, and GMDKNN had the best recall score.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed learning more about KNN today. Finding out that there were over 10 different versions of KNN was new to me. Studying the research paper with my group is also helpful, because they help me in places I'm not so good at, such as implementations, and I do the same for them. Hopefully tomorrow we get our data sets.
