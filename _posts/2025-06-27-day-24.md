what_i_learned: |
  We got our data sets today. Mine was a data set on strokes. We were each told to clean up our data tests and get perform some metric calculations using various machine learning algorithms, such as ELM, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Project. I spent most of the day trying to lcean up the data set, but in the end I got it done. After that, we had a meeting with our faculty mentor and graduate mentor, detailing our progress for the week.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Taking care of my own data set was a bit hard. I had to ask for help from my team members a lot, but it was rewarding. I also used overleaf to write down the results of my calculations, and I enjoy writing, so that was a nice break from coding. I'll probably finish the rest of the calculations next week, since I couldn't finish them today.
