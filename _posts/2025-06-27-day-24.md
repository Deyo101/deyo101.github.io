what_i_learned: |
  We got our data sets today. Mine was a data set on strokes. We were each told to clean up our data tests and get perform some metric calculations using various machine learning algorithms, such as ELM, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Project. I spent most of the day trying to lcean up the data set, but in the end I got it done.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed today's enrichment block. The Lost at Sea game was fun and the game we played to identify our teachers was cool too. Meeting Ron was a pleasant experience. I like the way the guy in the Decision Trees video explains the code, it's easier for me to follow along.
