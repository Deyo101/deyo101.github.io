what_i_learned: |
  I used various machine learning algorithms to predict the labels for my dat set today. I used ELM, SVM, KNN, decision tree, and random forest. I predicted the labels for both the training and testing data, then got the accuracy score for each of them. After that, I got the metric scores (mae, mse, rmse, percentage difference of rmse) of each of the algorithms and displayed them in a table. I then copied and pasted the table into the overleaf document my faculty mentor shared with us.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I like the progress I'm making so far. Working on the data set and writing out the progress and process I use on overleaf helps me to understand what I'm doing better. Writing a technical paper is new to me though, so it's also a bit confusing. Tomorrow I'll work more on finishing up the paper.
