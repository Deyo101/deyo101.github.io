what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused more on preparing the slides for the mid term symposium on Thursday. I filled in the slides assigned to me then practiced the demo my team is going to record. I also spent some time implementing the machine learning algorithms on the cleaned stroke data set. I finished cleaning it up yesterday.

blockers: |
  All my metric scores for ELM, SVM, and KNN were the same at first, but Amara told me to try implementing them all on different notebooks, and that fixed it.

reflection: |
  It's a bit stressful trying to condense everything we've learned into a powerpoint, so that took me some time. I'm also not really good at public speaking, so practicing with Ron tomorrow is going to be helpful. I still enjoy working on my data set, it's been a nice learning opportunity for me. Ron also bbought us donuts today so that was a highlight.
