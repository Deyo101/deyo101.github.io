what_i_learned: |
  I spent all my time today working on the slides for tomorrow's presentation. I got the charts and maps I needed to display on my slide, and filled in the required information. We also recorded our demo video. At the end of the day, we practiced our presentations with our mentors.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Preparing for the symposium has been a bit stressful. We started working on our slides a bit late, so everything is a bit rushed. I think our presentation went good, we're kind of ready for tomorrow. The only major thing we need to work on is our time management.
