what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on balancing the data using the SMOTE technique. After balancing the data, I spent most of my time getting the performance metrics using various machine learning algorithms. I also compared the accuracy score gotten when the ELM and the custom ELM were implemented on the balanced data set. It took me a while to implement the custom ELM because there were a few more steps to it than the usual ELM.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  The custom ELM gives a better accuracy score when used on the data set compared to the normal ELM. It was a bit time-consuming trying to figure out how to implement the custom ELM though, but I was able to get it done. The work for today wasa bit much, I only got a bit of it done. I'll probbaly finish the rest later this week.
