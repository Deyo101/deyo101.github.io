what_i_learned: |
  I worked on the balanced data set some more today. I used a different key for the custom ELM and got the accuracy score. Then I compiled all the information(metric scores), for both the training and testing data and set them up in a tabular form. It took me some time to get all the information I needed because my file from eysterday didn't save, so I had to start from the beginning.

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was frustrating having to redo what I'd spent all day yesterday doing. It took quite a bit of my time, but in the end I got it done. I like working with the custom ELM, the accuracy results it gives are a lot higher and better than the normal ELM. Tomorrow I'll work on the balanced data set with cross validation.
