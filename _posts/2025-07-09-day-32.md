what_i_learned: |
  In the past calulcations I'd done, the normal ELM had a really low accuracy score. So today I spent my time going through the data set and checking for any errors that could have caused that. I experimented on another data set I got from Github, and did the same thing I did to my stroke data set to the new data set. I cleaned it, balanced it out, then used ELM to get an accuracy score, and the score was quite high. This was just to give me some peace of mind that it wasn't due to a fault of mine that the ELM accuracy score in my stroke data set was low.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I'd been pondering on this problem since Monday so it was nice to get a definitive answer. I tried just going through my code from the top so I wouldn't have to use this much longer method to verify, but I found it better to just use this in the end. I'm glad I was able to get this sorted out today, since tomorrow I'll be moving on to balancing the stroke data set with cross validation. And I wouldn't want to get an error in that data set since it would skew my results.
