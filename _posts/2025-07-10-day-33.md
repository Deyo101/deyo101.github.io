what_i_learned: |
 I spent the first half of today at a writing workshop. When we all went back to our labs, I inputted the metric scores I'd gotten from the balanced without corss validation data set into Overleaf. Then I started working on balancing the data set with cross validation. I also got some metric scores for the data set.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed the writing workshop. It was insightful, and I got to talk some more with the other undergrads. Balancing the data set with crss validation was a bit tricky at first, but after a while I was able to get it done. Calculating the metric scores is probably the easiest part.
