what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on balancing the data with corss validation using the SMOTE technique. It took me some time to figure out how to balance the data with cross validation, but after I got that figured out, I was able to get the performance metrics easily. I used ELM, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and the custom ELMs to get the metric scores. At the end, I inputted the results into a table in Overleaf.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  The custom ELM didn't give a better accuracy score when used on the data set compared to the normal ELM this time. It was a bit oddd to come to that conclusion, but different data sets give different results. In the end, Decision Tree and Random Forest gave the best accuracy scores. Next week, I'm going to do the same thing I did this week, but using MATLAB or SPSS instead of python.
