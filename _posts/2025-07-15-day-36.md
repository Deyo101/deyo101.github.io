what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent the first half of the day at the business building. We had a short program that showed us our different learning styles and personality types. After that, we all went back to our teams. I worked more on my Overleaf project documentation, and also generated some metric scores for the imbalanced data set with cross validation.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  The program at the start of the day was fun. I'm getting to know more of the undergrad researchers in the program so that's nice. I'm more used to working with the data sets and geenrating the metric scores now, so it's easier for me now. I'm almost done with documenting my research.
