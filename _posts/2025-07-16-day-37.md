what_i_learned: |
  I forgot to add the ELM (Tanh) variant to each model before, so I started off with that. I added it to the balanced training and testing data with and without corss validation. Then I generated two bar charts for the accuracy results and percentage difference in RMSE results for both the training and testing data for the balanced data set with and without corss validation. After that, I uploaded all the graphs on Overleaf, and wrote a short analysis on the data shown in the tables.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Creating bar charts for each of the values (training and testing) for both sets of balanced data was quite time consuming. I had to create graphs for both the accuracy results and the percentage difference in RMSE results. Writing everything I did down in Overleaf has become easier for me to do now. Since I've completed everything on the balanced data set today, all I've got left to do is work on the imbalanced data set tomorrow.
