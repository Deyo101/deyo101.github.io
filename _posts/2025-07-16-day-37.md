what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent most of my time chronciling the results of my codes on Overleaf. I wrote down the things I did to clean up the data, balance it out, etc. I also created more visual charts to show the results. I described everything I've done from the beginning in extreme detail.
  
blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Writing everything I've done/been doing down was a bit challenging. I had to go back to my previously written codes and explain everything on Overleaf. My graduate mentor was very helpful. In the end, I was able to get most of it down.
