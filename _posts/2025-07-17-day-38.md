what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent the morning at the business building at a writing workshop. We practiced summarising our projects, among other little writing tasks. This is really helpful, because it helps in describing my work and progress in Overleaf. After that, I had to leave school early to go out of state.
  
blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Meeting up with everyone in the business school is nice. I enjoyed the workshop. I found it genuinely helpful. I also think it's helpful for my teammates.
