what_i_learned: |
  Today I met up with my faculty professor and gave a rundown of everything I accomplished this week. I presented my overleaf documents and the graphs I'd generated. He was happy with the work we'd all done. I also took part in the weekly team video.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Going through everything I've done this week made me feel very accomplished. Seeing my work compiled was nice. And getting the OK from my faculty mentor was also nice. I don't really like presenting my work though.
