what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on the imbalanced aspect of my code. I implemented ELM(Tanh) on the imbalanced code, both with and without corss validation, and recorded the performance metrics I got. I created bar charts of the accuracy results, percentage difference in RMSE, and time results. I then added all this to Overleaf.
  
blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  This was quite similar to working on the balanced data set. So it was easy. Drawing up all the graphs was time-consuming though. Writing everything down on Overleaf too.
