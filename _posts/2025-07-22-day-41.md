what_i_learned: |
  Today, my team and I worked on our elevator pitch for Thursday. We wrote down our script, practiced, then recorded the video. We then ran the video by our graduate mentor to make sure it was okay to submit. After that, I went over my code with my graduate mentor because the custom ELM was giving a low accuracy score for my balanced data set with cross validation.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Figuring out what to put in our elevator pitch and how to condense it was challenging. Our project is a bit difficult to understand, so figuring out a short script took some time for us. Our high scool teacher brought a VR headset for us to play around with, so that was also cool. Scouring through my code to fix the accuracy problem was not fun.
