what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working on the imbalanced part of my code. I generated a bar chart for the time column since I hadn't yet finished doing that, and uploaded that on Overleaf. I then wrote an analysis of the performance metrics for all the data sets. After that, I worked on my conclusion.
  
blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  The work I did today was easy. Generating the graphs for the time column and analyzing the information I had on Overleaf wasn't much trouble. Writing the conclusion wasn't hard either. I just need to perfect the box plots I created before, then I'll be done.
