what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on the final paper. I'm in charge of the abbreviations and formula section, so I started on that. I inputed all the abbreviations and columns from the two data sets and placed them in Overleaf in a tabular form. The, working closely with my graduate mentor, I wrote the formula section, which we changed to 'Understanding ELM'.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  The difficult parts of the project are coming to an end, so I'm relieved. Today was a simple day. It didn't take me long to type in the abbreviations. For the formula bit, it took me a bit longer since I was working with my graduate mentor, but in the end, we got it done.
