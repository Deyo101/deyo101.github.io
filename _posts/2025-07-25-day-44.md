what_i_learned: |
  Today, I finished up my section of the final paper. I cited all the papers we used in the References section of the paper. After that, I started working on the final presentation powerpoint. We all met with our faculty mentor at 3:30 to give him a run down on everything we did this week.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I'm happy it's Friday, 1 week down. The work I did today wasn't much. I finished up quite early, so I spent some time idle. Next week we're just going to be going over our final presentation.
