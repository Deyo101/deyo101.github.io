what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent my time working on the final presentation slide. I worked on a new section called Understanding ELM. It was some of the math formulas I wrote down in the final paper, so I just pasted them into the google slides using a math latex add-on. I also worked on some other sections of the google slide.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It wasn't hard working on the slides. Figuring out how to write down the math formulas was the only challenging bit. Today was a relatively calm day. I spent most of my day working on the slides.
