  Today, I spent most of my time working on the slides and final paper on Overleaf. Correcting and tweaking things here and there. Not much else was done other than that. I spent most of my time working on the slides and paper.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It's been quite slow. The program is wrapping up so there's not much left to do. Tomorrow we'll meet with our faculty mentor and practice for the presentation. We're almost done.
