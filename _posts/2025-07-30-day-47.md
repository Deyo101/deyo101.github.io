what_i_learned: |
  Today, I kept working on the slides and final paper. I touched up some stuff our faculty mentor asked us to. We then had a meeting with him where we presented the slides. He pointed out some things to correct, and we spent the rest of our time practicing for the presentation.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Tomorrow is the final presenatation so I'm a bit nervous. It's our last day as a team at MSU. Spending today prepping was good. It helped us brush up on our weak spots.
