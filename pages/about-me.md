  bio: |
    I’m currently a sophomore studying Computer Information Systems at Grambling State University in Grambling, Louisiana. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work explores the intersection of technology, culture, and community—how digital tools, data, and storytelling can empower underserved voices and drive impact.

    When I’m not working on projects or research, I enjoy exploring new places, co-leading youth initiatives like Preserve Our Roots, and learning more about AI and financial systems.
