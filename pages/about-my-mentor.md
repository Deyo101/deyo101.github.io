    Dr. Olaniyi Iyiola is an Associate Professor of Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at Morgan State University, MD. Dr. Iyiola has received several awards and recognitions including (i) Merit Award for Research (2020): Faculty Award (University wide), California University of Pennsylvania, PA, Outstanding teaching performance from the Dean, Arts & Sciences (Fall 2021 & 2022) for graduate level courses in Abstract Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis and Matrix Theory & Applications. (ii) Most cited paper since 2019 “Projection methods with alternating inertial steps for variational inequalities: Weak and linear convergence,” 2022 in Applied Numerical Mathematics (Q1 with 19% acceptance rate), (iii) Ranked among top 2% (2022 and 2023) worldwide scientists by citations and other metrics compiled by Stanford University using Elsevier database. (iv) Mark Lawrence Teply Award - Outstanding Research Potential (2017), graduate student award, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI. (v) Morris and Miriam Marden Award - High Quality Research Paper (2016), graduate student award, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.
    
    Dr. Iyiola’s research interests are in numerical analysis (algorithms & analysis for partial differential equations, integer and non-integer order), computational mathematics (simulations in application, PDE models, optimization), data science (data analytics, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence), mathematical biology and nonlinear operator theory involving fixed point algorithms for solving variational inequality problems, optimization, equilibrium problems, and nonlinear integral equations. Dr. Iyiola has extensive experience in formulating optimization models in both finite and infinite dimensions. His current research involves the development of new types of iterative schemes for optimization problems that capture complexities of real-life applications. He also has experience in developing numerical algorithms for solving non-linear problems with complex domains including equations that are numerically unstable unless the step size is taken to be extremely small. Dr. Iyiola is an expert in data mining and machine learning with skills in SAS/SQL, JMP, R, MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, Python, and Tableau.
