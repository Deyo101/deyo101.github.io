project_title: "Developing Cutting-Edge Algorithmic Approaches to Refine Machine Learning Systems for Complex Nonlinear Optimization in Biomedical Research"

problem: |
  Machine learning models often face challenges in achieving high prediction accuracy, especially in complex, nonlinear biomedical problems. There is a pressing need for algorithmic methods that can enhance the performance of these models, particularly in disease prediction using real-world medical data. This project addresses the gap by developing optimized algorithms to improve model output weights and enhance healthcare outcomes through early disease detection.

approach: |
  The project involves a comprehensive machine learning pipeline with the following steps:

  - Source and clean real-world medical datasets

  - Implement machine learning models including Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

  - Apply an Accelerated Self-adaptive Algorithm to optimize output weights for better accuracy

  - Use tools like Python, MATLAB, SPSS, and R for model building, statistical analysis, and visualization

  - Evaluate and compare model performance across various metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE, MAE, accuracy)

  - Document results and reflect on the real-world healthcare applications of the models


outcome: |
  By the end of the program, undergraduate students will contribute to a functional, optimized machine learning workflow. They will produce a cleaned dataset, working models with performance charts, and a final report or presentation. Success will be demonstrated through technical deliverables, weekly presentations, and the ability to apply and articulate machine learning solutions for disease prediction. Potential outcomes also include contributions to journal manuscripts and enhanced student skills in real-world AI applications in healthcare.
